# MenuV-Snippet-VS-Code
MenuV Snippet VS Code for FiveM <br>
This is the first version, there are not all the features, updates will appear in the next few days <br>
This menu was created by @ThymonA and it's a snippet for Visual Studio Code <br>
You can contact me on discord: Talec #4647 <br>
To install, you need to put this folder in your extensions folder of VS CODE, for me it's: F:\Visual studio code\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions
